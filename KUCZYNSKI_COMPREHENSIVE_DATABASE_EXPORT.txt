PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS (1628 total):
================================================================================


================================================================================
DOMAIN: EPISTEMOLOGY (11 positions)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-138
Work: Unknown
Title: Counterfactuals as epistemic probability relations

Position:
Counterfactuals don't really say anything about events or anything concrete... Counterfactuals merely register confirmation relations among propositions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-139
Work: Unknown
Title: Counterfactuals are crypto-probability propositions

Position:
if A had been the case, then B would have been the case means: The proposition K and P(A) gives a high probability to P(B), where K is the conjunction of propositions we know to be true, minus the proposition that A and B were not the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-140
Work: Unknown
Title: Probability is epistemic not metaphysical

Position:
It is clear, then, that probability is an epistemic, not a metaphysical, notion. Probability is a logical relation between propositions; it is not a property of states of affairs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-141
Work: Unknown
Title: False propositions probabilify other propositions

Position:
It must be kept in mind that false propositions probabilify other propositions just like true ones. The proposition the moon is made of cheese is false, but that doesn't stop it from giving a very high degree of probability (essentially 100%) to the proposition there is a piece of cheese that weighs more than 100 lbs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-142
Work: Unknown
Title: Counterfactual truth independent of empirical discoveries

Position:
surely the truth of (4) is not contingent on the outcome of such inquiries. So the factualist has mis-analyzed (4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-143
Work: Unknown
Title: The Frequency Theory of Probability is false

Position:
The Frequency Theory of Probability (FT) tells us that, in W2, the probability of a computer's never malfunctioning is 100%... This is plainly false. In each universe, the likelihood of computer-error is the same, even though, in W1 the likelihood seems high and, in W2, the likelihood seems low. (Chapter 7, 'Statistical trends reflective of, but distinct from, probabilities')

================================================================================
DOMAIN: FREE WILL (10 positions)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-014
Work: Unknown
Title: Determinism defined as universal causation

Position:
Dr. K: Determinism is the doctrine that nothing is uncaused. MAX: So if determinism is correct, then how the world is now determines exactly how it will be in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-015
Work: Unknown
Title: Indeterminism entails some chaos

Position:
Dr. K: If there is a single uncaused event, then indeterminism is correct, even if the universe is otherwise completely deterministic. And it doesn't matter how minute that event is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-016
Work: Unknown
Title: Indeterminism threatens freedom more than determinism

Position:
Dr. K: Indeterminism is more of a threat to freedom than determinism. In fact, determinism is not a threat to freedom. It is in fact necessary for it. Determinism is as necessary for freedom as indeterminism is fatal to freedom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-017
Work: Unknown
Title: External indeterminism doesn't increase freedom

Position:
Dr. K: would we be more free in W than we are here? MAX: No; if anything, less free. At least in our world, there are dependable mechanisms. So we can control it. But in W, we can't even do that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-018
Work: Unknown
Title: Internal indeterminism doesn't increase freedom

Position:
Dr. K: So to the extent that your nervous system is indeterministic, its condition at time t leaves it open whether I will make the requisite bodily movements... Your berry-knowledge won't necessarily lead to the right decision unless the mechanisms that convert knowledge into intentions are intact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-019
Work: Unknown
Title: Mechanisms require determinism

Position:
Dr. K: A mechanism is something that can be relied on to produce on output of a certain kind, when given an input of a certain kind... Where there are mechanisms, there is determinism. Where there is indeterminism, there are no mechanisms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-020
Work: Unknown
Title: Indeterministic minds are incoherent

Position:
Dr. K: The more its future condition fails to cohere with its present condition... it is therefore no mind at all, but rather a series of mutually isolated minds... Since its earlier states fail to cohere with its later states... So it exists only for an instant. And therefore doesn't exist at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-021
Work: Unknown
Title: Freedom requires appropriate mental state responsiveness

Position:
Dr. K: So this inner freedom you are discussing---one has it to the extent that one's current mental state embodies the appropriate sort of responsiveness to one's previous mental states... possession of this inner freedom is not about having a mind whose mental states don't determine one another; it is about having a mind whose mental states determine one another in the right way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-022
Work: Unknown
Title: Freedom as causal integration

Position:
Dr. K: Yes, a person is free if his mind is constitutive of the right sort of causal integration. MAX: And my view is that a person is not free unless his mind is constitutive of the right sort of causal integration, but I don't grant that a person is free if that condition is satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: FW-023
Work: Unknown
Title: Responsibility requires agent-constitutive causation

Position:
Dr. K: For an action on Stalin's part to be free is for Stalin to be responsible for it. And for Stalin to be responsible for it is for Stalin-constitutive forces to be responsible for it... And until such forces, such Stalin-constitutive forces, are in existence, we cannot talk of Stalin's being made to do this or that.


================================================================================
DOMAIN: LOGIC (16 positions)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-052
Work: Unknown
Title: Logic as the study of formal truth

Position:
Dr. K: It is the study of formal truth... A formal truth is a statement that holds entirely in virtue of its own structural properties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-053
Work: Unknown
Title: Mathematical logic studies statement-functions

Position:
Dr. K: Mathematical logic studies statement-functions. Most other branches of mathematics study numerical functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-054
Work: Unknown
Title: Negation preserves incompatibility

Position:
Dr. K: The negation of a statement is incompatible with that statement... The negation of someone is tall is it is not the case that someone is tall; in other words, nobody is tall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-055
Work: Unknown
Title: Truth-functional operators defined by truth tables

Position:
Dr. K: 'and', 'or', and 'not' are very special, since they are truth-functional, meaning that whether or not the output sentence is true depends only on whether or not input sentences are true.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-056
Work: Unknown
Title: Non-truth-functional operators exist

Position:
MAX: Because even if P and Q are both true, 'P because Q' isn't necessarily true... Given only that P is true, it does not follow that 'Jim knows that Mary is in Alaska' is true.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-057
Work: Unknown
Title: Recursive functions define logical systems

Position:
Dr. K: Notice that each of these functions if defined for its own outputs... this means that each of these functions is recursive... a system of logic is a recursively defined statement class. And logic is the study of such classes.

================================================================================
DOMAIN: METAPHYSICS (8 positions)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: META-051
Work: Unknown
Title: The universe is counter-entropic through life

Position:
MASTER: TO THE EXTENT THAT THE WORLD FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE DISCIPLINE OF PHSYICS, IT IS ENTROPIC... BUT NOTICE THAT, TO THE EXTENT THE WORLD FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF BIOLOGY, IT IS COUNTER-ENTROPIC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: META-052
Work: Unknown
Title: Indeterminism prevents composite objects

Position:
Dr. K: To the naked eye, a billiard ball looks like a single indivisible object. But it consists of trillions of micro-particles interacting with each one another... if those interactions weren't governed by deterministic laws... each particle would go its own way... and the billiard ball would powder into nothingness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: META-053
Work: Unknown
Title: States of affairs are causal processes

Position:
It seems to me part of our concept of a state of affairs (leaving aside completely instantaneous ones) that such things are causal sequences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: META-054
Work: Unknown
Title: Temporal priority defined causally

Position:
A standard definition of temporal priority is this: x precedes y iff some possible causal sequence (e.g., a beam of light) connects x to y... So it seems to me that x precedes y iff there is some causal process starting with x that ends with y.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: METH-046
Work: Unknown
Title: Discipline-relative counterfactual evaluation

Position:
What a biologist considers counterfactually possible differs from what a physicist would consider counterfactually possible... the physicist knows certain things that the biologist does not and that the economist knows certain things that the historian does not.

================================================================================
DOMAIN: MODAL LOGIC (6 positions)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: MODAL-025
Work: Unknown
Title: Factualist analysis of counterfactuals fails

Position:
The factualist view is not tenable... Two deterministic worlds cannot differ from each other with respect to a single state of affairs unless they differ with respect to a series of states of affairs extending back into the furthest recesses of time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: MODAL-026
Work: Unknown
Title: Possible worlds analysis requires circular mixture of determinism

Position:
The factualist needs the world to be simultaneously characterized by different mixtures of determinism and indeterminism. But this is an incoherent requirement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: MODAL-027
Work: Unknown
Title: Indeterminism destroys counterfactual truth conditions

Position:
if the macro-world here is indeterministic, then the factualist position is quite definitely false... The most one can say is: there is a 54% chance that it starts in w. Really, the proposition in w, under the circumstances described, the car starts seems to lack truth-value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: MODAL-028
Work: Unknown
Title: Worlds are not sets of propositions

Position:
Our world is not a set of propositions. Our world is something which makes sets of propositions be true or false. Any world deserving of the name is something which makes propositions be true or false. A set of propositions does not make propositions be true or false.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: MODAL-029
Work: Unknown
Title: Weak factualism is incoherent

Position:
the weak-factualist denies that counter-factuals merely register relations of probabilification (or entailment) among propositions. And he denies that counter-factuals register facts relating to other worlds (in any genuine sense of 'world'). So his position is completely incoherent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: MODAL-030
Work: Unknown
Title: Maximal consistent sets useless for counterfactuals

Position:
alternative worlds, in the sense of maximal consistent sets of propositions, are absolutely useless for analyzing counter-factuals.


================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF ACTION (8 positions)
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-008
Work: Unknown
Title: Action requires self-change

Position:
MASTER: NO, IT CANNOT, SINCE TO ACT IS TO CHANGE ONESELF.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-009
Work: Unknown
Title: Power presupposes freedom

Position:
Dr. K: There is freedom, and there is power. Power is the ability to convert freedom into desired results. But power presupposes the existence of freedom, and must therefore be distinguished from it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-010
Work: Unknown
Title: Intentions vs desires in action explanation

Position:
Dr. K: Intentions are grounded one's personality. Desires need not be so grounded. There are free floating desires: desires that are in one, but not of one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-011
Work: Unknown
Title: Compulsive actions achieve opposite of conscious intention

Position:
Dr. K: the end-result of a compulsively performed action is the opposite of the consciously intended result---and therefore coincides with the unconsciously intended result... [Compulsive kindness] affects her in the same way as acts of hostility. For that is what they are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-012
Work: Unknown
Title: Authentic action requires alignment of values and desires

Position:
Dr. K: Actual actions must embody beliefs as well as desire. But also necessary that the values in question be in alignment with the desires in question... Desire-driven acts that do not embody values have the authenticity of veritable actions, but not the requisite sublimity, and value-driven acts that do not embody desire have the requisite sublimity of veritable actions... The former are real, but they aren't actions. The latter are actions, but they aren't real.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-013
Work: Unknown
Title: Compulsive behavior as leaking not acting

Position:
MAX: even though those actions, for lack of a better word, do discharge Max's hatred of his mother, it isn't Max who is doing the discharging. It is rather that his sadism is leaking out of him... it almost fails to be his behavior. It is almost more appropriate to describe it as behavior that he undergoes than it is to describe it as behavior that he engages in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-014
Work: Unknown
Title: Deracinated values possess the agent

Position:
Dr. K: given how deracinated his values are---how lacking in any instinctual basis---it is less appropriate to describe them as values that he has than it is to describe them as values that have him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: ACTION-015
Work: Unknown
Title: True agency requires ideals not just passion

Position:
Dr. K: True agency is about the fulfillment of ideals---not necessarily ethical ideals, but ideals of some kind or other---and where there are no values there are ipso facto no ideals... Where there is desire without values, there is passion---in both the contemporary and the etymological senses of the word---but not action.

Work: Unknown
Title: Control over mind is prerequisite for freedom

Work: Unknown
Title: Laws cannot be defined except via counterfactuals

Position:
the possible-worlds analysis of counterfactuals is guilty of covert circularity. For, thus analyzed, counterfactuals can only be understood in terms of laws of nature... But there is widespread agreement that the concept of a law cannot itself be defined except in terms of the notion of a counterfactual (a law is inter alia something that supports counterfactuals).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-048
Work: Unknown
Title: Probability definable from actual events only

Position:
I also argue that the relevant kind of probability can be defined wholly in terms of what has happened (not what would happen and not even what must happen in a nomic sense). So my analysis isn't guilty of any kind of circularity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-049
Work: Unknown
Title: Critique of Humean analysis of laws

Position:
Hume says that laws are regularities involving certain kinds of states of affairs. But this presupposes that the notion of a state of affairs is a non-causal one. For obviously if states of affairs are themselves causal processes, then Hume's analysis becomes viciously circular.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-050
Work: Unknown
Title: Probability must be interpreted causally, not statistically

Position:
When it is said that that probability of a computer-malfunction is greater than 0%, the statement being made is to be interpreted causally, not statistically. What is being said is that, the laws of physics being what they are and the construction of the computer being what it is, it is a possibility, albeit one that may never be actualized, that brand-new/well-constructed/etc. computers malfunction. (Chapter 7, Conclusion)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-051
Work: Unknown
Title: Statistics are evidence of probabilities but not themselves probabilities

Position:
Statistics are evidence of probabilities; statistics are not themselves probabilities. According to FT [Frequency Theory], statistics are identical with probabilities; therefore, FT is false. Also, statistics are only as truth-conducive as they are consistent with the causal mechanisms that generate them. (Chapter 7, 'Evidence of probabilities vs. actual probabilities')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-052
Work: Unknown
Title: The W1/W2 thought experiment refutes the Frequency Theory of Probability

Position:
In W2, the likelihood that a given computer will behave in a program-compliant doesn't exceed the likelihood that a given computer in W1 will do so: the two probabilities coincide. But in W2 the previously-described rash of coincidences obscures the deterministic, and therefore that probabilistic, structure of events. (Chapter 7, 'Probability in relation to higher-order mechanisms')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-053
Work: Unknown
Title: Probability remains constant even when statistics are misleading due to coincidence

Position:
In a world governed by the same biological---and non-biological laws as ours, but in which by sheer coincidence smokers never got cancer/emphysema, doctors would be no less wrong than they would in our world to tell their patients that smoking was harmless... the probability, in that world, that a given smoker would succumb to cancer/emphysema would coincide with the corresponding probability in our world. (Chapter 7, 'Evidence of probabilities vs. actual probabilities')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-054
Work: Unknown
Title: Worlds with identical laws have identical probabilities regardless of statistical divergences

Position:
In each universe, the likelihood of computer-error is the same, even though, in W1 the likelihood seems high and, in W2, the likelihood seems low... What is going on is that, in W1, the statistics are consistent with the deterministic-probabilistic structure of the operative laws, whereas in W2 they are not. (Chapter 7, 'Statistical trends reflective of, but distinct from, probabilities')

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-055
Work: Unknown
Title: Worlds with different causal/nomic structures have different probabilities even if event-sequences are identical

Position:
Derived from the W1/W2 argument and the conclusion that 'probability... is to be interpreted causally, not statistically.' If probability depends on causal/nomic structure, then different causal/nomic structures entail different probabilities regardless of event-patterns. This directly refutes epistemic or statistical interpretations of probability.

Title: Consciousness maximizes energy efficiency

Position:

Title: Obsessive beliefs are pseudo-beliefs

Position:
Dr. K: if someone obsesses about his hatred of so and so, that is because he is not yet done with so and so. He is still attached to that person... if someone obsessionally believes that such and such, it is because what he actually believes is the opposite of such and such.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: PSY-133
Work: Unknown
Title: Compulsive actions are pseudo-actions

Position:
Dr. K: If one compulsively does such and such, it is because one's real intention is to do the opposite of such and such. If a given person compulsively avoids his ex-girlfriend, it is because he wants to see her.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: PSY-134

Title: OCD essence is ambivalence

Position:
Dr. K: the essence of OCD is ambivalence. The compulsively doting son both loves and hates his mother. He loves her, and therefore feels obliged to have lunch with her on Sunday. But he also hates her.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: PSY-135
Work: Unknown
Title: Doing and undoing in OCD

Position:
Dr. K: it is because of this emotional polarity within him that the obsessional engages in what Freud refers to as 'doing and undoing.' He does a given thing. Then he undoes it. And then undoes his undoing of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: PSY-137
Work: Unknown
Title: Symbolic representation in OCD symptoms

Position:
Dr. K: The stove represents undischarged libido... What he wants is for the stove to explode. The stove represents his passionate desire for his girlfriend. His 'fear' the stove will explode is really his desire that he---meaning his genital region---will, so to speak, 'explode.'

Title: Awareness without consciousness in the obsessional

Position:
Dr. K: This young man obviously is not consciously aware of his mother's treachery. But he is aware of it. He probably does not quite see it for what it is, even at the level of unconsciousness. But he is surely aware of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: PSY-139
Work: Unknown
Title: Single ultimate determinant despite overdetermination

Position:
MAX: ultimately, his behavior has only determinant, this being his sexual frustration... He is ambivalent towards his mother because she is causing him to be sexually frustrated. So his ambivalence and his sexual frustration are, at least in this context, operating as a single cause. Dr. K: Admirably well put, Max.

Title: Compulsive time management as defense

Position:

Title: AI Falsifies Enumerative Induction Model

Position:
AI systems demonstrate that successful induction does not proceed by enumerating instances and generalizing. Instead, AI uses pattern recognition, analogy, and constraint satisfaction that cannot be reduced to simple enumeration of cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-051

Title: AI Resolves Rationalism vs Empiricism Debate

Position:
AI systems demonstrate that knowledge acquisition requires both innate structure (rationalist element) and learning from data (empiricist element). Neither pure rationalism nor pure empiricism can account for AI's success. The debate is resolved by recognizing both are necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-053
Work: Unknown
Title: Innate Architecture is Necessary for Learning

Position:
AI systems require substantial innate architectural constraints to learn successfully from data. This vindicates the rationalist insight that some knowledge structure must precede experience, while acknowledging the empiricist insight that specific content comes from experience.

ID: EP-054
Work: Unknown
Title: Knowledge Acquisition is Neither Pure Discovery nor Pure Construction

Title: AI Solves the Gettier Problem

Position:
AI learning systems demonstrate a solution to the Gettier problem by showing that genuine knowledge requires not just justified true belief but also that the justification tracks truth through a reliable causal-computational process.

Title: Knowledge is Inherently Perspectival and Interactive

Position:
AI reveals that all knowledge, even 'objective' knowledge, begins from perspectival, interaction-based data driven by practical interests. There is no view from nowhere - even AI's knowledge is grounded in its interactions with reality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-063
Work: Unknown
Title: Tool-Creating Interaction Generates Irreducible Knowledge

Position:
Creating tools (including AI) generates knowledge that cannot be obtained from merely using tools or observing passively. Each level of reflexive interaction (tool use, tool creation, AI development) reveals new knowledge irreducible to lower levels. **LOGIC (8 positions): LOGIC-016 to LOGIC-023**

Title: Information Distinct From Evidence

Position:
All information is evidence, but not all evidence is information. Evidence requires only causal relatedness; information requires causal relatedness plus structure-preservation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-076
Work: Unknown
Title: Information-Transmission as the Basis of Knowledge

Position:
Knowledge is based on information-transmission. Our sense-perceptions are isomorphs of the objects they represent, inheriting structure from their causes. Beliefs are knowledge only to the extent they are linked by information-transmissive series to corresponding realities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-077
Work: Unknown
Title: Knowledge Independent of Statistical Reliability

Position:
The difference between knowledge and mere belief is not statistical. A belief is knowledge if and only if it is the end-result of an information-transmissive series, regardless of the general reliability of the mechanism that produced it.

Title: Descartes' epistemology responds to Church authority crisis

Position:
Descartes' epistemological project was fundamentally an attempt to cope with social unrest caused by science stripping Catholic Church of credibility. He sought new certainties to replace discredited Church certainties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-148
Work: Unknown
Title: Extreme rationalism correlates with anxiety about social change

Position:
Both Plato and Descartes advocate extreme rationalism (overplaying role of thought, underplaying observation) because both were uneasy about social changes - Plato unambivalently hostile, Descartes ambivalently accepting.

Title: EMH 'Priced In' as Unfalsifiable Tautology

Position:
EMH's concept of 'priced in' is logically circular: if price moves, information was priced in; if price doesn't move, information was already priced in. This makes EMH immune to contradiction but also immune to usefulness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-152
Work: Unknown
Title: EMH Collapses Signal-Noise Distinction

Position:
Under semi-strong and strong EMH, 'information' includes sentiment, rumors, trends, tweets, collective mood - leading to inversion where 'whatever drives prices is, by definition, information', collapsing distinction between signal and noise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Humility vs Equations in Understanding Alien Systems

Position:
If you want to understand a society, must allow it to remain strange - see its economy as living form of life not market-in-waiting. Takes humility, not equations.

Title: Knowledge Distinct From Awareness

Position:
Knowledge must be sharply distinguished from mere awareness. One can be aware of something without knowing anything about it, and one can know things without being directly aware of them.

Title: Information-Transmission as Structure-Preservation

Position:
Information-transmission is structure-preservation. An information-bearing series is one in which earlier events transmit their structure to later events through causal processes that preserve structural relationships.

Title: Information Distinct From Evidence

Position:
All information is evidence, but not all evidence is information. Evidence requires only causal relatedness; information requires causal relatedness plus structure-preservation.

Title: Information-Transmission as the Basis of Knowledge

Position:
Knowledge is based on information-transmission. Our sense-perceptions are isomorphs of the objects they represent, inheriting structure from their causes. Beliefs are knowledge only to the extent they are linked by information-transmissive series to corresponding realities.

Title: Knowledge Independent of Statistical Reliability

Position:
The difference between knowledge and mere belief is not statistical. A belief is knowledge if and only if it is the end-result of an information-transmissive series, regardless of the general reliability of the mechanism that produced it.

Title: Plato's extreme rationalism is political, not epistemological

Title: Empiricizing philosophy enables world-engagement

Position:
Locke and Hume were hard-core empiricists, their whole agenda as philosophers being to empiricize philosophy. Their criticism of existing philosophy was that it failed to engage the world... Their political philosophies—which were very good—did engage the world; but to the extent that they did, they were almost anti-philosophical.

Title: Empiricism collapses into skepticism/autistic withdrawal

Position:
Empiricism collapses into the view that we can have knowledge of nothing except our own conscious states... So in their attempt to make philosophy engage the world, Locke and Hume empiricized philosophy. But in empiricizing philosophy, Locke and Hume made philosophy collapse into pure skepticism, pure skepticism being the most compete conceivable autistic withdrawal from reality.

Title: EMH 'Priced In' as Unfalsifiable Tautology

Position:
EMH's concept of 'priced in' is logically circular: if price moves, information was priced in; if price doesn't move, information was already priced in. This makes EMH immune to contradiction but also immune to usefulness.

Title: AI as Epistemic Partner Not Amplifier

Position:

Title: Recursive Co-Modeling as New Form of Knowledge Generation

Position:
Reverse brain engineering is recursive co-modeling - dialogical process where line between subject and object, knower and known, begins to blur. When we build artificial minds that help us understand our own, we create mirrors that talk back.

Title: Conscious Experience as Epistemic Foundation

Position:
Conscious experience provides the epistemic foundation for all empirical knowledge, including physics itself. The apparent conflict between relativity and temporal experience cannot be resolved simply by declaring experience illusory, because conscious experience provides the epistemic foundation for all empirical knowledge. This means that theory-laden perception does not undermine perceptual justification - conscious experience remains foundational even when structured by background beliefs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: EP-162
Work: Unknown
Title: Subjective Standpoint and Epistemic Access

Position:
The connection to consciousness runs deeper than mere analogy. Temporal becoming might resist reduction to B-series relations because it essentially involves the subjective standpoint of a conscious observer. The subjective standpoint is not an epistemic limitation to be overcome but a constitutive feature of how conscious beings access reality. This means background beliefs that structure perception are part of the constitutive framework, not defeaters of justification.

Title: AI Vindicates Semantics-Pragmatics Distinction

Position:
Large language models demonstrate a clear distinction between semantic content (literal meaning) and pragmatic interpretation (context-dependent meaning). The success of LLMs requires maintaining this distinction, vindicating classical theories of meaning against pragmatist attempts to collapse semantics into pragmatics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LANG-034

Title: Classical Logic as Formalization Not Discovery

Position:
Classical logic is fundamentally inadequate as a tool for reasoning because it requires more intelligence to recognize that an inference instantiates a logical law than to recognize the validity of the inference directly.

Title: System L: Discovery Logic via AI

Position:

Title: Meta-Reasoning Patterns Generate New Inferences

Position:
System L uses higher-order templates for generating new inferences that go beyond simple deductive rules. Example template: 'If capability X requires mechanism Y, and mechanism Y can malfunction in way Z, then X implies the potential for Z-type malfunctions.'

Title: Four Principles: Entailment vs. Confirmation

Position:
Four logical principles hold: (i) Entailment is transitive; (ii) Confirmation is not transitive; (iii) Entailment is monotonic; (iv) Confirmation is non-monotonic. These differences show entailment and confirmation are fundamentally different relations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Material Conditional Does Not Capture "If-Then" Meaning

Position:
The symbol "→" in classical logic (material conditional) does not mean "if...then" in natural language. It merely means "not both P and not-Q" and is strictly truth-conditional, lacking the modal/entailment force of natural language conditionals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-CP002
Work: Unknown
Title: Natural Language Conditionals Are Modal

Work: Unknown
Title: The Paradoxes of Material Implication Are Not Genuine Paradoxes

Position:
The so-called "paradoxes of validity" (e.g., that a false statement entails anything) are not real paradoxes but arise from misconstruing "P→Q" as meaning "if P, then Q" when it actually only means "not (P and not-Q)".

Title: Confirmation Defined as Probability-Increase

Position:
P confirms Q if and only if P, supposing it true, increases the likelihood that Q is true. Confirmation does not by itself license inference from P to Q.

ID: LOGIC-026
Work: Unknown
Title: Conditions for Legitimate Inductive Inference

Position:
Q may legitimately be inferred from P if and only if: (a) the supposition that P is true and Q is false has fewer unexplainable consequences than the supposition that P and Q are both true, AND (b) the supposition that P is true has fewer unexplainable consequences than the supposition that P is false.

Title: Four Principles: Entailment vs. Confirmation

Position:
Four logical principles hold: (i) Entailment is transitive; (ii) Confirmation is not transitive; (iii) Entailment is monotonic; (iv) Confirmation is non-monotonic. These differences show entailment and confirmation are fundamentally different relations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LOGIC-028

Title: Entailment Not Maximal Confirmation

Position:
Entailment is not maximal confirmation. Entailment is a logical notion concerning what is counterlogical; confirmation is an explanatory notion concerning what is counterexplanatory.

Title: Relativization to Standards the Essence of Measurement

Position:
The essence of measurement is comparison with respect to a standard. All measurement, including 'absolute' measurement, is fundamentally relative comparison to stipulated standards.

Work: Unknown
Title: Three Axioms of Measurement Theory

Position:
Three axioms are necessary for any viable measurement system: (i) If L1>L2 and L2>L3, then L1>L3 (transitivity). (ii) If L1≠L2, one is greater (trichotomy). (iii) If L1=L2 and L2=L3, then L1=L3 (transitivity of identity). Violation makes measurement meaningless.

Title: Metrical Conventionalism Versus Strict Conventionalism

Position:
Conventionalism (laws are convention-based) differs from strict conventionalism (laws are convention-determined). Only the former is correct. That laws are expressed relative to conventional standards doesn't make them entirely conventional.

ID: METH-018
Work: Unknown
Title: Conventionalism Self-Defeating

Position:
Conventionalism is self-defeating. If laws hold in virtue of non-conventional relations between conventions and events (as conventionalism requires), then measurement standard choice is constrained by objective facts, undermining conventionalism.

Title: Cell Biology Analogy Supports Collective-First Methodology

Position:
Just as individual cells are better understood in terms of their role in multicellular organisms rather than as autonomous individuals pursuing their own survival, individual humans are better understood in terms of their roles in human collectives. Cell-individualism can be explained in terms of cell-collectivism, but not vice versa; similarly for person-individualism and person-collectivism.

Title: Collective Behavior Cannot Be Explained by Individualist Assumptions

Position:
It is very difficult to explain group behavior - whether mobs or advanced cultures - on the assumption that collectives represent averages of behaviors of autonomous individual deciders. Outside of contexts with immediate physical threats or prospects of crude gratification, people give far too much weight to existing beliefs and mores in far too well-defined ways to be accounted for by individualist hypotheses.

ID: MIND-049
Work: Unknown
Title: Consciousness Has Functional Role Absent in Current AI

Position:
AI systems demonstrate that many cognitive functions traditionally associated with consciousness (perception, reasoning, learning) can occur without consciousness.

Title: Names as Concept-Laden Labels

Position:
Names are mere labels (non-descriptive), as Kripke argued, but labels 'pick up' descriptive information through how one learns their reference. Semantics (what expressions literally mean) differs from knowledge of semantics (how meaning is known), and this difference explains apparent descriptive content.

Title: Co-referential Names Can Differ in Meaning

Position:
'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' differ in meaning despite co-referring. 'Superman is in the building' says that a certain property-set (superhuman strength, flight ability, etc.) is uniquely instantiated and any such instance is in the building. 'Clark Kent is in the building' says a different property-set (reporter, wears glasses, etc.) is uniquely instantiated.

Title: Literal Meaning is Real but Emergent

Position:
Literal meaning is real rather than illusory, but emergent rather than primary. It develops through triangulation from contextual uses rather than being foundational to language.

ID: LANG-030
Work: WORK-011
Title: Grammar and Logic Are Aligned

Position:
LLMs' ability to make correct inferences without FOL-style logical forms suggests grammatical structure itself guides valid reasoning. Perceived misalignment between grammatical and logical form may be artifact of our chosen formal systems rather than feature of language itself.

Title: Logical Form is Cognitively Inert

Position:
Traditional logical form is cognitively inert: people reason without it, LLMs function without it, it plays no role in actual inference. Logical form is constructed rather than discovered, follows rather than guides comprehension, and is system-relative rather than unique.

Title: AI Vindicates Semantics-Pragmatics Distinction

Position:
Large language models demonstrate a clear distinction between semantic content (literal meaning) and pragmatic interpretation (context-dependent meaning). The success of LLMs requires maintaining this distinction, vindicating classical theories of meaning against pragmatist attempts to collapse semantics into pragmatics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LANG-034
Work: Unknown
Title: Literal Meaning is Computationally Prior to Pragmatic Interpretation

Title: AI Vindicates Syntax-Semantics Interface

Position:
Large language models demonstrate that grammatical structure (syntax) and meaning (semantics) are distinct but systematically related. The success of LLMs requires explicit representation of this interface, vindicating classical grammatical theory against attempts to reduce one to the other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LANG-037
Work: Unknown
Title: Syntactic Structure Constrains Semantic Interpretation

Position:
AI language systems reveal that syntactic structure constrains possible semantic interpretations. This supports the classical view that grammar is not arbitrary convention but reflects systematic constraints on meaning composition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: LANG-038
Work: Unknown
Title: Compositional Semantics Requires Syntactic Structure

Title: AI Success Without Consciousness Reveals Consciousness is Not Required for Intelligence

Position:
The success of AI at intelligent tasks without consciousness demonstrates that consciousness is not necessary for intelligence per se, but may be necessary for specific types of cognitive integration or self-awareness.

Title: Phenomenal Consciousness vs Functional Consciousness Distinction

Position:
AI reveals a crucial distinction between phenomenal consciousness (subjective experience) and functional consciousness (information integration, self-monitoring). AI can have functional analogs without phenomenal properties.

Title: Philosophical Skepticism Projects Internal Doubts onto External World

Position:
Philosophers' and obsessive-compulsives' supposed doubts about the external world are displaced, projected doubts about the internal world. Neither has genuine doubts about external reality, but both are doubtful about their internal psyche.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: MIND-055
Work: WORK-016
Title: Intellectualism as Reaction to Dark Psychological Depths

Position:
The intellectualism of both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives is a reaction to and attempt to cloak their darkly retrograde psychological condition. They fancy themselves rational actors when they are actually driven by rage, narcissism, and fear.

Title: Cartesian Mind-Body Dualism as Defensive Idealization

Position:
The Lockean/Cartesian insistence on the non-existence of the unconscious and the claim that mind extends only as far as consciousness is a tendentious rationalization—a defensive idealization of the self as purely rational that denies the Nietzschean depths beneath the Cartesian veneer.

Work: WORK-012
Title: Individuals as Limiting Cases or Special Roles Within Collectives

Position:
Bona fide individuals - people who genuinely think for themselves (geniuses) - can be understood as limiting cases of collectives (collectives of one), as rogue actors, or most likely as members of collectives who occupy unusual offices and are therefore wrongly seen as not being part of those collectives.

Title: Phenomenology Resists Reduction to Physical Description

Position:
Temporal experience exhibits the same kind of first-personal, qualitative character that makes consciousness irreducible to physical description. Just as Nagel's argument against materialism succeeds by showing that objective physical description cannot capture subjective experience, so temporal becoming might resist reduction to B-series relations because it essentially involves the subjective standpoint of a conscious observer. The phenomenology of experience has irreducible epistemic significance.

Title: Confirmation Requires Principled Generalizations

Position:
Only principled (nomic/causal) generalizations, not accidental generalizations, can be confirmed. When 'All ravens are black' is read as a principled generalization, it has nomic content and is not equivalent to 'All non-black things are non-ravens.'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: AI Systems Test Philosophical Theories Empirically

Position:
Philosophical theories about reasoning, knowledge acquisition, scientific discovery can be empirically tested by examining whether successful AI systems operate according to those theories. AI provides concrete examinable implementations allowing theory adjudication.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-003
Work: WORK-011
Title: Logic of Discovery is Possible

Position:
Contrary to traditional philosophy of science claiming logic of discovery is impossible, examining AI scientific reasoning reveals identifiable principles guiding successful theory generation. Genuine logic of discovery exists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-004
Work: Unknown
Title: AI Falsifies Popperian Falsificationism

Position:
AI's success in scientific discovery falsifies Popper's theory that science proceeds primarily through conjecture and refutation. AI systems generate successful theories through pattern matching and inductive generalization, not primarily through bold conjectures and attempts at falsification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-005
Work: Unknown
Title: Inductive Discovery Precedes Deductive Testing

Position:
Contra Popper, successful scientific discovery requires inductive pattern recognition to generate plausible hypotheses before deductive testing. AI demonstrates that purely conjectural approaches without inductive guidance are ineffective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-006
Work: Unknown
Title: Reverse Brain Engineering as Scientific Method

Position:
By building AI systems that replicate cognitive functions, we can infer the computational architecture necessary for those functions. This 'reverse engineering' of the brain through AI construction represents a new and powerful methodology in philosophy of science and cognitive science.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-007
Work: Unknown
Title: AI Falsifies Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation

Position:
AI's successful explanatory practices falsify the deductive-nomological (covering law) model of explanation. AI generates successful explanations through pattern recognition, analogy, and causal modeling that don't require deduction from universal laws.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-008
Work: Unknown
Title: Causal-Mechanistic Explanation Doesn't Require Universal Laws

Position:
AI demonstrates that causal-mechanistic explanation can be successful without appeal to universal laws. Understanding how something works doesn't require subsuming it under exceptionless generalizations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-009
Work: Unknown
Title: Explanatory Understanding Through Pattern Recognition

Position:
AI reveals that explanatory understanding can be achieved through recognition of patterns and structural similarities rather than derivation from laws. This suggests explanation is more about grasping relevant relationships than deductive systematization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-010
Work: Unknown
Title: Laws of Nature Not Confined to Actual Objects

Position:
The scope of natural law is not confined to actual or even possible objects. Many laws hold with respect to classes all of whose members are merely possible or even prohibited by other natural laws.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-011
Work: Unknown
Title: Knowledge of Imperceptibles Identical with Conditional Knowledge

Position:
Knowledge of the imperceptible is identical with knowledge of conditional truth. Knowledge of future, past, possible, and imperceptible present states is always conditional knowledge based on laws.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-012
Work: Unknown
Title: Three Kinds of Imperceptibles

Position:
Physical objects can be imperceptible in three ways: (1) imperceptible due to severed causal processes (objects in other rooms); (2) imperceptible due to size but perceptible with technology (cells, molecules); (3) imperceptible by natural law regardless of technology (photons, subatomic particles).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-013
Work: Unknown
Title: The Epistemic Function of Natural Law

Position:
Scientists aspire to identify natural laws so they can, when given context-specific information, make true statements about future, past, or possible behavior of contexts. Laws enable conditional prediction and explanation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-014
Work: Unknown
Title: Science Prioritizes Principles Over Particular Facts

Position:
Any interest science has in a given particular fact is subordinate to its interest in the general principles in terms of which that fact is to be understood. Scientists study particular instances only insofar as they instantiate general laws.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-015
Work: Unknown
Title: Laws May Be Place and Time-Sensitive

Title: Hume's Regularity Analysis of Causation Is False

Position:
Hume's Regularity Analysis - the view that causation is nothing but constant conjunction, that 'X causes Y' means 'events of type X are regularly followed by events of type Y' - is demonstrably false.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-017
Work: Unknown
Title: Hume-Worlds Observationally Different from Non-Humean Worlds

Work: Unknown
Title: The Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation Is False

Position:
The Deductive-Nomological (DN) model - which holds that to explain event E is to derive E from natural laws plus antecedent conditions - is fundamentally mistaken. Explanation requires causal knowledge, not merely law-subsumption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-019
Work: Unknown
Title: DN Viciously Circular via Counterfactual Support

Position:
The DN model is viciously circular if it requires laws to support counterfactuals (as Hempel proposes). Counterfactuals are cryptocausal statements; knowing them requires knowing causes; but knowing causes already provides explanations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-020
Work: Unknown
Title: Causal Knowledge as Differential Knowledge

Position:
Causal knowledge is differential knowledge - knowledge of what varies with what. To know causes is to know which changes depend on which other changes and in what proportions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-021
Work: Unknown
Title: Causation as Proportionality Restoration

Position:
Causation is fundamentally proportionality restoration. Effects are proportional to their causes (threshold effects aside). When a force acts on an object, the resulting change is proportional to the force magnitude.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-022
Work: Unknown
Title: Physical Laws as Regularities of Proportion

Position:
Physical laws are regularities of proportion rather than simple universal generalizations. Laws describe how magnitudes vary proportionally with each other rather than stating that all Fs are Gs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-023
Work: Unknown
Title: Knowledge-Why Equals High-Resolution Knowledge-What

Position:
To have knowledge-why is to have high-resolution knowledge-what. Explanatory knowledge differs from mere descriptive knowledge in degree of detail and specificity, not in kind.

ID: SCI-024
Work: Unknown
Title: The Raven Paradox a By-Product of Regularity Analysis

Position:
The Raven Paradox (that non-black non-ravens confirm 'all ravens are black') is an artifact of the Regularity Analysis of causation. Once causation is properly understood, the paradox dissolves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-025
Work: Unknown
Title: Determinism Doesn't Entail Complete Predictability

Position:
Star Trek: TOS wasn't just sci-fi but psychological diagram - Kirk/Spock/McCoy map exactly onto Freud's ego/superego/id and his three libidinal character types (narcissist/obsessional/libidinal).

Title: Philosopher-king doctrine as mission statement, not abstract ideal

Title: 'Intentions of the Framers' Denotes Idealization Not Empirical Reality

Position:
When we speak of 'the intentions of the framers', we are committed to an idealization rather than empirical actuality. The various framers (Adams, Jefferson, Washington) had numerically and qualitatively different minds, so talk of their collective intentions is institutional rather than psychological.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-014
Work: WORK-017
Title: Originalism Involves Vicious Circularity

Position:
Originalism collapses into circularity (or triviality): Constitutional interpretations are to be evaluated in terms of framers' intentions, but the framers' intentions are to be understood in terms of the historical and social role of Constitutional interpretation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-015
Work: WORK-017
Title: Framers' Intentions as Theoretical Constructs Presupposing Conceptions of Constitutionality

Position:
The expression 'intentions of the framers' denotes an idealization—a theoretical construct with no precise spatiotemporal counterpart. The theories embodied in uses of this expression concern the role the Constitution should have, so originalism is viciously circular or trivial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-016
Work: WORK-017
Title: Counterfactuals About Framers Presuppose Rather Than Ground Constitutional Interpretations

Position:
When legal theorists run counterfactuals about what Jefferson would have said about contemporary issues (like gay marriage), they are not making empirical statements but a priori propositions about what he should have said given his values. This presupposes rather than grounds conceptions of Constitutionality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-017
Work: WORK-017
Title: Idealized Jefferson Incorporates Normative Commitments About Constitutionality

Position:
When we talk about 'what Jefferson would have said', we're talking about what some idealization of Jefferson would have said—a Jefferson purged of cultural limitations and temporal parochialism. This idealization incorporates a certain conception of Constitutionality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-018
Work: WORK-017
Title: 'Jefferson's Values' Denotes Idealization Creating Parallel Circularity

Position:
The expression 'Jefferson's values' itself denotes an idealization rather than psychological reality, involving a circularity parallel to that in 'framers' intentions'. We use conceptions of Constitutionality to identify which values are 'his', then use those values to determine Constitutionality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-019
Work: WORK-017
Title: Historical Counterfactuals Replace Empirical Propositions with A Priori Propositions About Values

Position:
Once we start dealing with idealizations of framers' psyches rather than their actual psyches, we have replaced empirical propositions about their psychology with a priori propositions about values. Such counterfactuals presuppose conceptions of Constitutionality and thus cannot substantiate them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-020

Title: Originalism Condemns Itself to Vicious Circularity or Innocuous Tautology

Position:
The originalist position, when properly understood, collapses into either vicious circularity (using Constitutional conceptions to identify framers' intentions/values, then using those to determine Constitutional meaning) or innocuous tautology (the Constitution means what we think it should mean).

ID: POL-021

Title: Originalist Must Identify Values Before Running Counterfactuals, Creating Circle

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: POL-007

Title: Anarchism Fails on Pragmatic Grounds

Position:
While Goldman may be right that the state causes some crime and often behaves unjustly, anarchism fails because without state enforcement of contracts and provision of public goods, people cannot achieve the standard of living and freedom they desire. The benefits of the state outweigh its costs.

Title: Primitivism/Tribalism Fails on Pragmatic Grounds

Position:
Rousseau's vision of pre-civilizational tribal life as ideal fails because tribal life involves serious disadvantages: lack of choices in profession and lifestyle, lack of medical care and education, geographical confinement, lack of technology, and need to work for every meal. These disadvantages outweigh any advantages of simpler social organization.

ID: POL-009

Title: Tribal Life Was Not Idyllic

Position:
Contrary to Rousseau's romanticization, tribal life was likely not placid and carefree. Tribes attacked one another and were capable of behaving cruelly toward their own members. The evidence does not support the claim that pre-civilizational life was psychologically or morally superior.

Title: Classical Liberalism is Probably Approximately Correct

Position:
Hayek's liberalism - the position that good government is minimal government that protects people, gives them freedom, but otherwise doesn't interfere - is likely at least approximately correct.

Title: Competition is Superior to Central Planning

Position:
Following Hayek, competition is superior to central planning not only because it's more efficient, but because it's the only method that doesn't require coercive or arbitrary intervention by authority. Competition allows individuals to decide for themselves whether the prospects of an occupation compensate for its disadvantages.

Title: The Republic as conservative propaganda disguised as political philosophy

Position:
What Plato is discussing in the Republic is not the philosopher's ideal society, or some abstract notion of justice, or the human good. What Plato is discussing is the class-relations of Athenian society, and he is doing so in such a way as to rationalize the existing class-divisions.

Title: Plato's Good/Real equivalence as coded social stability doctrine

Position:
In the Republic, Plato also links 'the Good' with 'the real': which makes no sense if taken literally... But Plato is really speaking in code... The 'good'--i.e. the 'real'--is what conduces to social stability; and 'the bad'--i.e. the 'mere shadows'--are what threaten social stability.

Title: Cultural Hollowness Laments as Status Anxiety

Position:

Title: Appeals Process as Ritual Audit Not Truth-Seeking

Position:
Appeals courts don't ask 'Was justice done?' but 'Were the rules followed?' They evaluate procedural/legal errors, not actual innocence. Legal system views trial as ritual and appellate process as ritual audit - concern is whether form was maintained, not whether defendant is innocent or guilty.

Title: Mental Illness is Contextual; Physical Illness is Not

Position:
Mental illnesses are contextual in nature—being an asset in some contexts and a liability in others—while physical illnesses like asthma, lupus, or cancer are simply liabilities in all contexts.

Title: OCD is Ultimately Voluntary

Position:
OCD is ultimately a voluntary condition and an affliction of the will. If one chooses to leave the defensive bubble and re-engage the world, OCD becomes irrelevant or assumes benign/productive forms.

ID: PSY-015
Work: WORK-016
Title: OCD Prognosis Depends on Volitional Choice

Position:
The prognosis for OCD is 100% positive if seen as ultimately voluntary, but negative if seen as garden-variety pathology outside the scope of will. OCD is eliminated or made adaptive by exercising will in growth-oriented ways.

Title: Group Psychology is Explanatorily Prior to Individual Psychology

Position:
Contrary to standard psychological methodology, group psychology should be understood as explanatorily fundamental, with individual psychology being derivative.

Given how unintelligent, ignorant, and lacking in moral fiber most individuals are, yet how much intelligence, knowledge, and moral rigor is embodied in collective behaviors (corporations, academic disciplines), it is implausible that collectives are mere aggregations of individuals pursuing their own paths.

Title: Economics Not Self-Contained Predictive System

Position:
Economics is not self-contained system that can predict itself. It's downstream of culture, politics, religion, personality, invention. Charismatic leader can redirect nation's economy in week.

Serial murder has long existed (Gilles de Rais, Elizabeth Báthory, slaughtering priests of empires). What's new isn't behavior but recognition as distinct category - product of modern bureaucratic state with tools to track, name, mythologize recurring patterns.

Title: Trauma as Trigger Not Cause of Serial Killing

Position:
Many serial killers had disturbing upbringings but 'trauma = serial killer' doesn't track. Most abuse victims don't become serial murderers. Some notorious killers didn't experience abuse exceeding ordinary dysfunction. Trauma is trigger sparking very particular pre-existing architecture.

Title: Serial Killerdom as Evolutionary Spandrel or Vestigial Adaptation

Position:
If behavior is specific, structured, eerily reproducible, must ask where it came from. Evolution repurposes, mutates, experiments with hyper-specialists. Serial killerdom perhaps: spandrel (byproduct of adaptive features), vestigial adaptation, or extreme failure mode of modules serving critical social functions.

Title: Serial Killers as Overclocked Predator Mode

Position:
What sets serial killers apart isn't violence but method: they stalk, hunt, blend in, mimic normal social behavior with chilling precision. Not moral deformity but overactivation of predator mode made grotesque by misfiring reward circuits and unregulated internal narratives.

Title: Economic Theory as Intellectual Colonization

Position:
When Western-trained economist attempts to manage non-Western economy, doesn't observe or listen but immediately translates: 'What's your interest rate? Marginal productivity? Utility function?' None make sense in native conceptual world, but economist is there to re-code not learn.

Title: Flattening Sacred into Economic Data

Position:
Incan administrator describes labor system organized around sacred seasons, familial debt, reciprocal land stewardship. Economist replies: 'Ah yes, non-monetary kinship-based tax structure with redistributive efficiency function.' But that's not what it is - that's just bad translation. The ritual is no longer ritual, sacred no longer sacred.

Title: AI Falsifies Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation

Position:
AI's successful explanatory practices falsify the deductive-nomological (covering law) model of explanation. AI generates successful explanations through pattern recognition, analogy, and causal modeling that don't require deduction from universal laws.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-008

Title: Knowledge of Imperceptibles Identical with Conditional Knowledge

Position:
Knowledge of the imperceptible is identical with knowledge of conditional truth. Knowledge of future, past, possible, and imperceptible present states is always conditional knowledge based on laws.

Work: Unknown
Title: Three Kinds of Imperceptibles

Position:
Physical objects can be imperceptible in three ways: (1) imperceptible due to severed causal processes (objects in other rooms); (2) imperceptible due to size but perceptible with technology (cells, molecules); (3) imperceptible by natural law regardless of technology (photons, subatomic particles).

Title: Hume's Regularity Analysis of Causation Is False

Position:
Hume's Regularity Analysis - the view that causation is nothing but constant conjunction, that 'X causes Y' means 'events of type X are regularly followed by events of type Y' - is demonstrably false.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-017
Work: Unknown
Title: Hume-Worlds Observationally Different from Non-Humean Worlds

ID: SCI-018
Work: Unknown
Title: The Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation Is False

Position:
The Deductive-Nomological (DN) model - which holds that to explain event E is to derive E from natural laws plus antecedent conditions - is fundamentally mistaken. Explanation requires causal knowledge, not merely law-subsumption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-019
Work: Unknown
Title: DN Viciously Circular via Counterfactual Support

Position:
The DN model is viciously circular if it requires laws to support counterfactuals (as Hempel proposes). Counterfactuals are cryptocausal statements; knowing them requires knowing causes; but knowing causes already provides explanations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-020
Work: Unknown
Title: Causal Knowledge as Differential Knowledge

Position:
Causal knowledge is differential knowledge - knowledge of what varies with what. To know causes is to know which changes depend on which other changes and in what proportions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ID: SCI-021
Work: Unknown
Title: Causation as Proportionality Restoration

Position:
Causation is fundamentally proportionality restoration. Effects are proportional to their causes (threshold effects aside). When a force acts on an object, the resulting change is proportional to the force magnitude.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Physical Laws as Regularities of Proportion

Position:
Physical laws are regularities of proportion rather than simple universal generalizations. Laws describe how magnitudes vary proportionally with each other rather than stating that all Fs are Gs.

Title: Probability is causal, not statistical

Position:
When it is said that probability of a computer-malfunction is greater than 0%, the statement being made is to be interpreted CAUSALLY, not statistically. Probability is a function of laws and causal mechanisms, not observed frequencies.

Title: W1/W2 thought experiment refutes Frequency Theory

Position:
W1: laws say P(malfunction)=10%, statistics show 10%. W2: same laws, P(malfunction)=10%, but by coincidence statistics show 0%. Frequency Theory wrongly says P(W2)=0% but P(W1)=10%. Both actually have P=10% (determined by laws).

Title: Smoking-cancer example refutes Frequency Theory

Position:
