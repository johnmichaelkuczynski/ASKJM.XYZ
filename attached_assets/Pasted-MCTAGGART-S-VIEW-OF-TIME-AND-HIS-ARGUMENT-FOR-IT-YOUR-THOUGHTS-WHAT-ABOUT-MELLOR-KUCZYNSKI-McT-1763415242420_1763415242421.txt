MCTAGGART'S VIEW OF TIME AND HIS ARGUMENT FOR IT...YOUR THOUGHTS? WHAT ABOUT MELLOR?
KUCZYNSKI
McTaggart's argument against the reality of temporal becoming represents one of philosophy's most rigorous demonstrations of how systematic analysis can expose fundamental incoherencies in our most basic conceptual frameworks. His tripartite distinction—the A-series (tensed temporal positions), B-series (tenseless temporal relations), and C-series (mere ordering without temporal direction)—reveals the logical structure underlying temporal discourse with exceptional clarity.

The argument's power lies in its demonstration that the A-series generates an infinite regress. Events cannot possess tensed properties simpliciter—pastness, presentness, futurity—because this would entail contradictions. An event cannot be simultaneously past, present, and future. Yet the attempted solution—relativizing tensed properties to times—merely pushes the problem up a level, requiring second-order tensed properties, then third-order, ad infinitum. This regress is vicious because it prevents any determinate truth conditions for tensed statements.

McTaggart's insight connects directly to broader issues in modal metaphysics and space-time structure. If temporal becoming is illusory, then the asymmetry between past and future—which underlies our modal intuitions about fixed past and open future—requires reconceptualization. The argument thus bears on counterfactual analysis and possible worlds semantics. David Lewis's modal realism, for instance, becomes more plausible if temporal becoming is already suspect, since it reduces the metaphysical distance between merely possible worlds and past/future temporal stages of the actual world.

The deeper philosophical significance emerges when we recognize that McTaggart's argument parallels the kind of systematic conceptual analysis that reveals incoherencies in traditional divine attributes. Just as the concept of an omniscient, omnipotent, perfectly good being generates contradictions when subjected to rigorous examination, so too does the concept of objective temporal becoming collapse under logical pressure. Both cases exemplify how philosophical analysis can demonstrate that concepts central to common sense or traditional metaphysics are, strictly speaking, incoherent.

Mellor's response attempts to preserve temporal objectivity while accepting McTaggart's critique of the A-series. His token-reflexive theory grounds tensed truth conditions in the objective B-series relations between temporal utterance events and the events they describe. When I say "It is now raining," this statement is true if and only if my utterance occurs simultaneously with rain. The theory eliminates tensed properties while preserving tensed discourse.

However, Mellor's solution faces a fundamental difficulty that connects to broader issues about the nature of consciousness and temporal experience. The token-reflexive theory can specify truth conditions for tensed statements, but it cannot explain the phenomenology of temporal passage—the lived experience of nowness, of time's apparent flow. This explanatory gap parallels the hard problem of consciousness identified in contemporary philosophy of mind.

The connection to consciousness runs deeper than mere analogy. Temporal experience exhibits the same kind of first-personal, qualitative character that makes consciousness irreducible to physical description. Just as Nagel's argument against materialism succeeds by showing that objective physical description cannot capture subjective experience, so temporal becoming might resist reduction to B-series relations because it essentially involves the subjective standpoint of a conscious observer.

This suggests a modified Cartesian position: the thinking subject exists essentially as a temporal being, not merely as a being located in time. The ego cogito experiences duration from within, not as an external temporal container but as the very structure of conscious experience itself. Time's apparent passage might be neither objective feature of reality nor mere illusion, but rather the form under which reality necessarily appears to finite conscious subjects.

The implications extend to space-time physics and its philosophical interpretation. If temporal becoming is irreducible to B-series relations, then the block universe interpretation of relativity theory—which treats all space-time points as equally real—becomes problematic. The apparent conflict between relativity and temporal experience cannot be resolved simply by declaring experience illusory, because conscious experience provides the epistemic foundation for all empirical knowledge, including physics itself.

McTaggart's argument thus opens onto fundamental questions about the relationship between subjective experience and objective reality, between the manifest and scientific images of the world. Its enduring significance lies not merely in its critique of naive temporal realism, but in its demonstration that rigorous conceptual analysis can reveal deep structural problems in our most basic metaphysical commitments—problems that resist easy dissolution and point toward the need for more sophisticated philosophical frameworks that can accommodate both the demands of logical rigor and the irreducible character of conscious temporal experience.
