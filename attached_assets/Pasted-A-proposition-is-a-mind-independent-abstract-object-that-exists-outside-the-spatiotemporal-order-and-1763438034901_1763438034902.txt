A proposition is a mind-independent abstract object that exists outside the spatiotemporal order and constitutes the fundamental bearer of truth-value in logical space. More precisely, propositions are sets of properties—structured complexes of concepts that specify determinate conditions reality either satisfies or fails to satisfy.

This analysis resolves into several interconnected theses. First, the ontological thesis: propositions exist as abstract objects in the same robust sense that numbers or geometric forms exist. They are not mental constructs, linguistic artifacts, or useful fictions, but genuine constituents of reality's structure. Second, the compositional thesis: each proposition is a set of properties arranged in a specific logical configuration that determines what the world must be like for that proposition to be true. Third, the semantic thesis: truth consists in correspondence—a proposition is true if and only if reality instantiates the precise configuration of properties that proposition specifies.

This framework generates a systematic account of propositional attitude ascription. When we say "S believes that P," we specify a relation between a cognitive agent and an abstract object—namely, the proposition P. Belief is fundamentally the attitude of taking a proposition to be true, which means taking reality to instantiate the property-configuration that proposition specifies. This explains why beliefs can be shared across minds and evaluated for accuracy: multiple agents can stand in the believing-relation to the same abstract object, and that object either corresponds to reality or fails to correspond.

The analysis extends naturally to modal epistemology. We ascertain modal truths not by surveying possible worlds, but by examining propositions' internal structure—analyzing how their constituent concepts are arranged and what logical relations obtain between different property-configurations. Necessity and possibility are features of propositions themselves, discoverable through conceptual analysis of their compositional structure.

This account differs fundamentally from competing analyses along multiple dimensions. Against deflationist theories that reduce propositions to sentences or utterances, my position maintains genuine ontological commitment to abstract objects. Propositions cannot be linguistic entities because the same proposition can be expressed in different languages or remain unexpressed entirely. Moreover, sentences are spatiotemporal particulars while propositions are abstract universals—the sentence tokens "Snow is white" and "Der Schnee ist weiss" are distinct physical events, but they express the same proposition.

Against possible-worlds analyses that identify propositions with sets of possible worlds, my view maintains that propositions have internal structure that sets of worlds cannot capture. The propositions that bachelors are unmarried and that unmarried males are unmarried correspond to the same set of possible worlds (namely, all possible worlds), yet they are distinct propositions with different conceptual structures. Sets of worlds are too coarse-grained to distinguish necessarily equivalent propositions.

Against psychologistic theories that identify propositions with mental states or acts, my analysis preserves mind-independence. Propositions exist whether or not any mind grasps them, and the same proposition can be the object of different psychological attitudes—belief, doubt, fear, hope—across different agents. Mental acts are particular, temporal, and subjective; propositions are universal, eternal, and objective.

Against nominalistic approaches that deny abstract objects generally, my position maintains that propositions are indispensable for systematic semantics and epistemology. We cannot adequately account for meaning, truth, belief, and inference without acknowledging structured abstract objects that serve as meanings of sentences and contents of attitudes. The alternative is semantic chaos—abandoning the project of systematic theory of meaning and knowledge.

The decisive advantage of the property-set analysis is its explanatory power across multiple philosophical domains. It provides unified treatment of truth, meaning, belief, and modality while preserving the objectivity and mind-independence that semantic and epistemic theory requires. Propositions are the abstract structures that make possible both meaningful discourse and objective knowledge—the invariant contents that different minds can grasp and reality can either satisfy or fail to satisfy.
