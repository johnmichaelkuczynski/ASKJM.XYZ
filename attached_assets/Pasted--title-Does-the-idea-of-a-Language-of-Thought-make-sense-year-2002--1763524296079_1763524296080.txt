    "venue": "Communication and Cognition: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly Journal 35 (4): 173-192",
    "abstract": "Sense-perceptions do not have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are presentations, not representations. Linguistic expressions do have to be deciphered if their contents are to be uploaded, the reason being that they are representations, not presentations. It is viciously regressive to suppose that information-bearing mental entities are categorically in the nature of representations, as opposed to presentations, and it is therefore incoherent to suppose that thought is mediated by expressions or, therefore, by linguistic entities...",

    "abstract": "We are aware of truths and also of states of affairs. The distinction between truth-awareness (conceptual) and object-awareness (non-conceptual) is often overlooked. Because self-knowledge originally consists of object-awarenesses, only later taking the form of truth-awarenesses, a failure to distinguish between object- and truth-awareness has led many to advocate the false contention that self-conscious creatures can be categorically mistaken as to what they are consciously experiencing...",

    "abstract": "This paper puts forth two reasons to hold that at least some mental entities are not physical entities. First argument: Some mental entities (qualia) cannot possibly differ from how they seem to be. Second argument: Mental-physical identifications can only ever be theoretical, never observational, because mental events and physical events inhabit different data-spaces...",

    "abstract": "The statement \"mind is an emergent property of matter\" is either false or vacuous depending on how the term \"emergent\" is interpreted. Either it means mind is literally produced by matter (false) or it means psychological truths are not analytically derivable from physical truths at a given time (vacuous, because it leaves open future reducibility).",
