    "No stable predictive laws can govern systems whose components systematically respond to predictions about those systems.",

    "A discipline cannot be predictive when its domain constantly produces phenomena whose existence could not have been anticipated from the discipline’s existing theoretical resources.",
    "Any invariants general enough to be true of all economic systems are too abstract to ground specific predictions. Any principles specific enough to ground predictions fail to be invariant.",
    "The predictive failure of economics is not contingent—it is necessary, given what economies are and what economics attempts to do."

  "summary_short": "Kuczyński’s strongest and most systematic argument yet that economics cannot be a predictive science because of reflexivity, constant emergence, and the open-system nature of economies.",

  "summary_medium": "The paper demolishes the equilibrium paradigm by showing that economies are open, reflexive, and constantly emergent systems. Reflexive agents change the system when they become aware of predictions; genuine novelty arises continuously; path-dependence and evolving ontology make timeless laws impossible. The endogenous/exogenous distinction collapses, and purported invariants are either tautological or too abstract. Economics must abandon physics-envy and accept its status as a historical-interpretive discipline rather than a predictive science.",
